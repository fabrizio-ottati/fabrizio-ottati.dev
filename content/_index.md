title: Just for fun

I come from a [very small town](https://www.comune.cuccarovetere.sa.it/) in Italy. There I used to spend my days reading [Topolino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topolino), playing football and dreaming about becoming a **scientist** (I love this word!).
Then, I studied electronic engineering at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it), until I started my Ph.D. there with a focus on **brain-inspired computing** (not from the start but that's a long story).

I truly believe in open-source. The person that inspired me is [Linus Torvalds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF_5EKNX0Eg), with his two magnificent projects: [Linux](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) and [git](https://git-scm.com/). In the end, however, who really introduced me to open-source is [Gregor Lenz](https://lenzgregor.com), with its project [Tonic](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic), and helped me to start my first one, [expelliarmus](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/expelliarmus).

Since then, lots of things have happened: I got **Art√π** and **Merlino** from the shelter; I deepened my knowledge in **digital hardware** design; I learned to code (almost) properly; I started enjoying [piedmontese red wine](https://www.cascinadellerose.it/vino/langhe-nebbiolo-doc/) thanks to Filippo; I started messing around with [spiking neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12894) and [event-based cameras](https://lenzgregor.com/posts/event-cameras/); now, here I am, with my last project, [Open Neuromorphic](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic), built thanks to the help of Gregor Lenz and [Jason Eshraghian](https://jasoneshraghian.com).

I believe that **open-source** is the only right way of creating **software** (and maybe **hardware**); I like to believe that I can contribute translating the **human brain** to silicon; I truly believe in **open science** and that knowledge should be shared among as much people as possible and it should be **free**; I deeply believe in science **ethics**.

Don't take me for a wanna-be-visionary. [I am not](https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxlk2mMM43KKbc3mTPQZm7Em_40eK44k1X). I just want to have fun.
