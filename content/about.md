title: 'About'
---

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electronics and Communications](https://www.det.polito.it/) of [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), under the supervision of professor [Luciano Lavagno](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tRCNWC4AAAAJ&hl=en).

My Ph.D. research focuses on digital hardware design and automation with the goal of improving deep learning models efficiency.

My main areas of interest are 
* event-based vision. 
* digital hardware design.
* high level synthesis (HLS).
* computer science (I am particularly fascinated by algorithms).
* brain inspired computing (mainly, spiking neural networks).
* deep learning.

I am the maintainer of two open source projects in the field of **neuromorphic computing**, [Tonic](https://tonic.readthedocs.io) and [Expelliarmus](https://github.com/expelliarmus.readthedocs.io), and the founder of [Open Neuromorphic](https://open-neuromorphic.org).
