# Introduction

Fabrizio Ottati is a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electronics and Communications](https://www.det.polito.it/) of [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), under the supervision of professor [Luciano Lavagno](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tRCNWC4AAAAJ&hl=en) and professor [Mario Roberto Casu](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=qWQ_5fEAAAAJ&hl=en).

His main interests are **event-based vision**, **digital IC design** and **spiking neural networks**. He is the maintainer of two open source projects in the field of **neuromorphic computing**, [Tonic](https://tonic.readthedocs.io) and [Expelliarmus](https://github.com/expelliarmus.readthedocs.io).

# Projects 

## Open Neuromorphic

![onm](/images/about/onm.png)

This [organisation](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic) is created by a loose collective of **open-source** collaborators across **academia**, **industry** and **individual contributors**. What connects us is the **love for building tools** that can be used in the **neuromorphic community** and we want to share ownership of this vision. Open Neuromorphic (ONM) provides two things:

1. A **curated list of software frameworks and hardware projects** to make it easier to find the tool you need.
2. A **platform for your code**. If you wish to create a new repository or migrate your existing code to ONM, please get in touch with us. You will be made a member of this organisation immediately.

Projects that we list here can fall into this non-exclusive list of categories:

* **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** training and/or inference, for both ML and neuroscience application.
* **Event-based sensor** data handling.
* **Digital hardware** designs for neuromorphic applications.
* **Mixed-signal hardware** designs for neuromorphic applications.

## Expelliarmus 

![expelliarmus](/images/about/expelliarmus.png)

A Python [package](https://expelliarmus.readthedocs.io) for **decoding DVS binary data** formats to NumPy structured arrays.

## Tonic

![tonic](/images/about/tonic.png)

[Tonic](https://tonic.readthedocs.io) provides publicly available **event-based vision and audio datasets** and **event transformations**. The package is fully compatible with PyTorch Vision / Audio to give you the flexibility that you need. The project has been created by [Gregor Lenz](https://lenzgregor.com).
