title: 'About' 
---

I come from a 
[pretty small village](https://www.e-borghi.com/en/village/Salerno/377/cuccaro-vetere) 
in the south of Italy. Since I was a kid, I have been interested in
science and computers.

I moved to [Torino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin) for my studies. Here I
did my Ph.D. in electronics engineering, under the supervision of Professor
Luciano Lavagno, working in an amazing team, focusing on high level
synthesis of digital circuits and deep learning acceleration on FPGAs. 

Now I am working as AI/ML Processor Engineer in [NXP](https://www.nxp.com).

I have two beautiful cats, Artù and Merlino. I love them. A lot. 

My main areas of interest are:
* event-based vision. 
* deep learning.
* digital hardware design.
* computer science (still trying to finish a proper algorithms and data
  structures course since 2020).

I co-maintain two open source projects in the field of **neuromorphic
computing**, [Tonic](https://tonic.readthedocs.io) and
[Expelliarmus](https://github.com/expelliarmus.readthedocs.io), and the founder
of [Open Neuromorphic](https://open-neuromorphic.org). You can download my
**CV** from [here](/docs/cv.pdf).
