Fabrizio Ottati is a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electronics and Communications](https://www.det.polito.it/) of [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), under the supervision of professor [Luciano Lavagno](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tRCNWC4AAAAJ&hl=en) and professor [Mario Roberto Casu](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=qWQ_5fEAAAAJ&hl=en).

His Ph.D. research focuses on applying HLS for efficient inference of SNN models on digital hardware. 

His main areas of expertise are 
* event-based vision. 
* digital hardware design, for both ASICs and FPGAs.
* High Level Synthesis (HLS).
* C/C++ and Python programming.
* neuromorphic computing.

He is the maintainer of two open source projects in the field of **neuromorphic computing**, [Tonic](https://tonic.readthedocs.io) and [Expelliarmus](https://github.com/expelliarmus.readthedocs.io), and the founder of [Open Neuromorphic](https://open-neuromorphic.org).
