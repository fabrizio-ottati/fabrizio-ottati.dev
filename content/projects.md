## hls4nm

![hls4nm](/images/about/hls4nm-logo.png)

`hls4nm` is my Ph.D. thesis. It focuses on implementing SNN models on (Xilinx) FPGAs for fast and efficient inference. I am the main developer and I collaborate with [Jason Eshraghian](https://jasoneshraghian.com) to port [snnTorch](https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch/) models to my framework. 

The hardware development flow is based on High Level Synthesis, using Vitis HLS, developed by AMD Xilinx. 

The logo has been adapted from the [hls4ml](https://github.com/fastmachinelearning/hls4ml) one, merging it with the [Open Neuromorphic](https://open-neuromorphic.org) organisation logo developed by [Gregor Lenz](https://lenzgregor.com).

## Open Neuromorphic

![onm](/images/about/onm.png)

This [organisation](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic) is created by a loose collective of **open-source** collaborators across **academia**, **industry** and **individual contributors**. What connects us is the **love for building tools** that can be used in the **neuromorphic community** and we want to share ownership of this vision. Open Neuromorphic (ONM) provides two things:

1. A **curated list of software frameworks and hardware projects** to make it easier to find the tool you need.
2. A **platform for your code**. If you wish to create a new repository or migrate your existing code to ONM, please get in touch with us. You will be made a member of this organisation immediately.

Projects that we list here can fall into this non-exclusive list of categories:

* **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)** training and/or inference, for both ML and neuroscience application.
* **Event-based sensor** data handling.
* **Digital hardware** designs for neuromorphic applications.
* **Mixed-signal hardware** designs for neuromorphic applications.

Get in touch with the organization on [Discord](https://discord.gg/JParSCNe5k)!

## Expelliarmus 

![expelliarmus](/images/about/expelliarmus.png)

A Python [package](https://expelliarmus.readthedocs.io) for **decoding DVS binary data** formats to NumPy structured arrays.

## Tonic

![tonic](/images/about/tonic.png)

[Tonic](https://tonic.readthedocs.io) provides publicly available **event-based vision and audio datasets** and **event transformations**. The package is fully compatible with PyTorch Vision / Audio to give you the flexibility that you need. The project has been created by [Gregor Lenz](https://lenzgregor.com).

# Awesome Neuromorphic Hardware 

This [repository](https://github.com/fabrizio-ottati/awesome-neuromorphic-hw) collects papers, docs, codes about neuromorphic hardware for anyone who wants to do research on it. I am continuously improving the project. Welcome to PR the works (papers, repositories) that are missed by the repo. Inspired by [awesome-model-quantization](https://github.com/htqin/awesome-model-quantization).
