This is a list of books that I enjoyed reading and studying during my university years (and also now). Click on the titles to be redirected to the sources. 

## [*The Linux Command Line*](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php), William Shotts

This is the book that taught me almost everything I know about shell programming, scripting and Linux. It is incredibly good. Before reading the book, I recommend to check [William Shotts' website](https://linuxcommand.org) since it contains an introductory tutorial to Linux. 

## [*The Algorithm Design Manual*](https://www.algorist.com/), Steven S. Skiena

For the "Algorithm and Data Structures" course that I followed, it was an incredibly good reference: practical explanation of algorithms, no pseudocode (I hate it!), good reference list at the end for well known problems.

## [*Learning Python*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-python-5th/9781449355722/), Mark Lutz

This is the book that taught me Python. It is incredibly well written and I always come back to it when I wanted to understand how a Python feature works or if I want to learn new concepts.

## [*CMOS Circuit Design, Layout and Simulation*](https://cmosedu.com/cmos1/book.htm), R. Jacob Baker

The go-to source when messing with analog design and layout. No questions about it. I learned a lot from it during my "Analog Integrated Circuits" class. It allowed me to design this beauty.

## [*Deep Learning with PyTorch*](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-pytorch), Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga and Thomas Viehmann

This is the book that I used to learn PyTorch. It has a lot of good examples, it teaches how tensors work, how to write your code to allow batch processing, neural network design and training. It is incredibly useful as starting point for PyTorch development.
