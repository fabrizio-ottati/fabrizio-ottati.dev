## Data formats for event-based data

In contrast to PNG/JPG for images, there is no standard format for events. When streaming data from an event camera, we get millions of tuples of microsecond timestamps, x/y coordinates and polarity indicators per second that look something like this:

    [(11718661,  762, 147, 1) (11718665,  833, 184, 1)
     (11718669, 1161,  72, 1) (11718674, 1110, 100, 0)
     (11718679, 1073,  23, 1) (11718684, 1134,  56, 1)
     (11718688,  799, 304, 0) (11718691,  391, 289, 0)
     (11718694,  234, 275, 1) (11718699,  512, 335, 1)]


With the emergence of event-based sensors, likewise came numerous ways how to store the data. A straightforward idea is to resort to existing packages such as hdf5 and numpy. When training spiking neural networks, file reading speed is a bottleneck we need to keep in mind. As the spatial resolution of event cameras grows, we receive more and more events per second! Training on bigger datasets means that we want to keep in mind the file reading speed of our data. Here we list the results of our benchmark of different file type encodings and software frameworks that can decode files. 

![Comparison among file size and read speed of different encodings and software tools.](/images/blog/expelliarmus/file_read_benchmark.png)

The file size depends on the encoding, whereas the reading speed depends on the particular implementation of how files are read. In terms of file size, we can see that numpy doesn't use any compression whatsoever, resulting in some 1.7GB file for our sample data. Prophesee's [evt3](https://docs.prophesee.ai/stable/data/encoding_formats/evt3.html) format achieves the best compression by cleverly encoding differences in timestamps. In terms of reading speed, numpy is the fastest as it doesn't deal with any compression on disk. Unzipping the compressed events from disk on the other hand using h5py is by far the slowest. Using [Expelliarmus](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/expelliarmus) and the [evt2](https://docs.prophesee.ai/stable/data/encoding_formats/evt2.html) file format, we get very close to numpy reading speeds while at the same time only using a fourth of the disk space. This becomes particularly important for larger datasets which can easily reach some 3-4TB when encoded in an inefficient file format. 

## Prophesee encoding formats

[Prophesee](https://prophesee.ai) is one of the major event cameras vendor. Their cameras use three main encoding algorithms for their data: DAT, EVT2 and EVT3. By encoding algorithm it is identified the process by which an event sensed by the camera, consisting in a tuple `(timestamp, x_address, y_address, polarity)`, is encoded to a binary data format. 

### DAT

![DAT format](/images/blog/expelliarmus/dat-format.png)

The [DAT](https://docs.prophesee.ai/stable/data/file_formats/dat.html) format encodes an event to a 64 bits word. However, when reading the events from the binary file in chunks of 64 bits on a Little Endian (LE) machine, the image above does not correspond to reality. The following representation, instead, results to be correct:

```
    4 bits     14 bits     14 bits           32 bits
  ---------------------------------------------------------
 | Polarity | Y address | X address |       Timestamp      |
  ---------------------------------------------------------
```

Each DAT recording can store an event stream lasting at most **1 hour and 12 minutes**, since the timestamp maximum value is 4294967295 Î¼s (unsigned 32 bits maximum value).

The C++ code to decode a DAT event is the following:

```cpp
/** Function that decodes a DAT event to a (ts, x, y, p) tuple.
 *
 *  @param[in]  buff    64 bits buffer read from the DAT file.
 *  @param[out] ts      64 bits timestamp.
 *  @param[out] x       16 bits x address.
 *  @param[out] y       16 bits y address.
 *  @param[out] p       8 bit polarity.
 *
 *  @return     isEvent True when an event has been decoded.
 */
void decode_event(
    const uint64_t buff, 
    int64_t& ts, 
    int16_t& x, 
    int16_t& y, 
    uint8_t& p
    ) {
    const uint64_t mask_32b = 0xFFFFFFFF; 
    const uint32_t mask_14b = 0x3FFF; 

    const uint32_t upper_32b = (buff >> 32); // Upper 32 bits.
    const uint32_t lower_32b = (buff & mask_32b); // Lower 32 bits.

    ts = lower_32b; // Timestamp.
    x = upper & mask_14b; // X address.
    y = (upper >> 14) & mask_14b; // Y address
    p = upper >> 28; // Polarity.

    return true; 
}
```

One can notice that the events are not compressed but simply encoded to a compact binary format. 

### EVT2

Here things get interesting. For [EVT2](https://docs.prophesee.ai/stable/data/encoding_formats/evt2.html), each event is encoded to a **32** bits word; in particular, two kinds of events are used: `CD_OFF` and `CD_ON`, respectively associated with **negative** and **positive** polarity events.

A CD event is structured in the following way: 

```
          4 bits          6 bits      11 bits     11 bits
  ---------------------------------------------------------
 | Event type (on/off) | Timestamp | X address | Y address |
  ---------------------------------------------------------
```

* the first 4 bits are the event type. One might see this as the value of the polarity bit.
* then, 6 bits are dedicated to the timestamp. However, the full resolution time stamp is given by this merged with the **upper 28 bits** passed in another event, called `TIME HIGH`, as it is shown in the following: 

![EVT2 timestamp encoding](/images/blog/expelliarmus/evt2-timestamp.jpg)

Hence, the **lower 6 bits** are passed during a `CD_*` event, while the **upper 28 bits** are passed during a `TIME HIGH` event, which is structured in the following way: 

```
       4 bits                    28 bits
  --------------------------------------------------------
 | Time high code |             Timestamp                 |
  --------------------------------------------------------
```

Since the lower 6 bits change **more frequently** than the upper ones, many events can be encoded in `CD_*` ones before sending out a new `TIME_HIGH` reference. 

Probably the reader would like to see some code, and here it comes:

```cpp
/** Function that decodes an EVT2 event to a (ts, x, y, p) tuple.
 *
 *  @param[in]   buff    32 bits buffer read from the DAT file.
 *  @param[out]  ts      64 bits timestamp.
 *  @param[out]  x       16 bits x address.
 *  @param[out]  y       16 bits y address.
 *  @param[out]  p       8 bit polarity.
 *
 *  @return      isEvent True when an event has been decoded.
 */
bool decode_event(
    const uint32_t buff, 
    int64_t& ts, 
    int16_t& x, 
    int16_t& y, 
    uint8_t& p
    ) {
    const uint32_t mask_28b = 0xFFFFFFF; 
    const uint32_t mask_11b = 0x7FF; 
    const uint32_t mask_6b = 0x3F; 

    static uint64_t tsHigh = 0; // Static so that ts_high value is 
                                // remembered the next time the 
                                // function is called.
    bool isEvent = false; 
    
    uint8_t evt_type = buff >> 28; 

    switch (evt_type) {
        case 0x0: // CD_OFF
        case 0x1: // CD_ON
            ts = (tsHigh << 6) | ((buff >> 22) & mask_6b); 
            x = (buff >> 11) & mask_11b; 
            y = buff & mask_11b; 
            p = evt_type; 
            isEvent = true;
            break; 

        case 0x8: // TIME_HIGH
            tsHigh = buff & mask_28b; 
    }

    return isEvent; 
}
```

The version that actually works is available [here](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/expelliarmus/blob/cc9fbf1f53bfccd75c920e37d4ed94aa5aec3b1b/expelliarmus/src/evt2.c#L169).

### EVT3

With [EVT3](https://docs.prophesee.ai/stable/data/encoding_formats/evt3.html), data compression is higher: events are encoded to **16 bits** words but there ate many more event types, as it is shown in the following table, taken from [Prophesee documentation](https://docs.prophesee.ai/stable/data/encoding_formats/evt3.html).

![EVT3 event types](/images/blog/expelliarmus/evt3-event-types.png)

The logic behind EVT3 is the following:  a new event is registered when the **`x` address** changes. From this principle, one has to register a camera event when one of the following three events appear in the stream:
* `EVT_ADDR_X`: single event with the `x` coordinate encoded to it, together with polarity. The timestamp and `y` address have been passed in previous events. This event is structured as follows:

```
       4 bits         1 bit             11 bits
  --------------------------------------------------------
 | EVT_ADDR_X code | Polarity |        X address          |
  --------------------------------------------------------
```

* `VECTOR_12`: 12 events vectorized in a single data buffer. In particular, starting from a **base `x` address**, denoted with `baseX` in the code, all the events in this buffer are placed in the next 12 horizontal pixels (i.e. with `y` fixed and `x` varying) starting from `baseX`:

```
        4 bits         1 bit             11 bits
  --------------------------------------------------------
 | VECT_BASE_X code | Polarity |      Base X address      |
  --------------------------------------------------------
```

The mask vector is encoded in the following way: 

```
       4 bits                     12 bits
  --------------------------------------------------------
 | VECTOR_12 code |            Validity mask              |
  --------------------------------------------------------
```

Not all the events in the vector are valid: only the ones to which a bit equal to 1 in the validity mask depicted above is associated! For this reason, a validity mask made up of 12 bits is provided: if we consider the mask a vector of 12 integers of value either 0 or 1, the pseudo-code to interpret it is the following:

```cpp
for (int i=0; i<12; i++) {
    if (mask[i] == 1) {
        isEvent = true; 
        xAddr = baseX + i; 
    } else {
        isEvent = false; 
    }
}
```

An example of vectorized event is the following:

```
   4 bits                   12 bits
  --------------------------------------------------------
 | VECTOR | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
  --------------------------------------------------------
```

This leads to the following events being encoded to output (keep in mind that we are reading starting from the LSB, i.e. from the right side of the mask):

```
              Event associated to mask bit #0
  --------------------------------------------------------
 | Timestamp |   baseX + 0   |  y address  |   polarity   |
  --------------------------------------------------------

              Event associated to mask bit #1
  --------------------------------------------------------
 | Timestamp |   baseX + 1   |  y address  |   polarity   |
  --------------------------------------------------------

              Event associated to mask bit #6
  --------------------------------------------------------
 | Timestamp |   baseX + 6   |  y address  |   polarity   |
  --------------------------------------------------------

              Event associated to mask bit #9
  --------------------------------------------------------
 | Timestamp |   baseX + 9   |  y address  |   polarity   |
  --------------------------------------------------------

              Event associated to mask bit #11
  --------------------------------------------------------
 | Timestamp |   baseX + 11  |  y address  |   polarity   |
  --------------------------------------------------------
```
Since we are dealing with a 12 bit buffer, the pseudo-code is actually the following: 

```cpp 
for (int i=0; i<12; i++) {
    if (mask & 1) { // Reading the LSB.
        isEvent = true; 
        xAddr = baseX + i; 
    } else {
        isEvent = false; 
    }
    mask = mask >> 1; // Moving on to the next bit.
}
```

* `VECTOR_8`: same as `VECTOR_12` but with 8 events encoded in the vector.

What about timestamps? Well, now the timestamp is encoded to a **24 bits** data buffer, separated in two events: `TIME_LOW` for the lower 12 bits, `TIME_HIGH` for the upper 12 bits. Each of these events is encoded as follows:

```
         4 bits                     12 bits
  --------------------------------------------------------
 | TIME HIGH/LOW code |            Timestamp              |
  --------------------------------------------------------
```

Hence, we need to glue together these values to get the full timestamp, as it is shown in the following picture taken from Prophesee documentation.

![EVT3 time high and low parts of the timestamp](/images/blog/expelliarmus/evt3-time-high-time-low.png)

The full C++ code to handle EVT3 events is shown in the following.

```cpp
/** Function that decodes an EVT3 event to a (ts, x, y, p) tuple.
 *
 *  @param[in]   buff    16 bits buffer read from the DAT file.
 *  @param[out]  ts      12 entries array of 64 bits timestamps.
 *  @param[out]  x       12 entries array of 16 bits x addresses.
 *  @param[out]  y       12 entries array of 16 bits y addresses.
 *  @param[out]  p       12 entries array of 8 bit polarities.
 *
 *  @return      isEvent True when an event has been decoded.

This code is just for demonstration purposes, it won't actually work, since we need to take care of other things such as timestamp overflows.
