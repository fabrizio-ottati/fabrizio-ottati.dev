## Introduction

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Electronics and Communications](https://www.det.polito.it/) of [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/), under the supervision of professor [Luciano Lavagno](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tRCNWC4AAAAJ&hl=en) and professor [Mario Roberto Casu](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=qWQ_5fEAAAAJ&hl=en).

My main interests are event-based cameras, digital IC design, spiking neural networks and piedmontese red wine. I am the maintainer of two open source projects in the field of neuromorphic computing, [Tonic](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic) and [expelliarmus](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/expelliarmus).
