## Introduction

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronics and Communications of Politecnico di Torino, under the supervision of professor Luciano Lavagno and professor Mario Roberto Casu.

My main interests are event-based cameras, digital IC design, spiking neural networks and piedmontese red wine. I am the maintainer of two open source projects in the field of neuromorphic computing, [Tonic](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic) and [expelliarmus](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/expelliarmus).
